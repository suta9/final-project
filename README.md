This Program is made to study, explain and visualize the Differentiation and Integration of the Acceleration Formula.

The program works as follows:
1. The Derivative and Integral modules in "Main" file can show a result in differentiation or Integration provided you enter the formula in the brackets
2. Each of the modules are located in the files called "Derivative" and "Integral". it is required to have these files in the same directory to run the code in the "Main" file.
3. "Derivative" and "Integral" contains a code that calculates and plots a graph of the differentiation and integration
4. The Graph of both programs shows the initial graph, the one time Differentiate/Integrate graph and the second time Differentiate/Integrate
5. The Example programs must be ran with no arguments in the brackets
